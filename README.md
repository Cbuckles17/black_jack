# Black Jack
This was my first experience with Unity and knowing this there are probably some parts of my code that are not up to spec. I will gladly accept any critiques.

## Getting Started

There are two options here: 

* Add the project to Unity
* Run the executable (Windows only) from the Build directory.

### Prerequisites

Clone the project into some folder:

```bash
cd unity/projects
git clone https://github.com/Cbuckles17/black_jack.git black_jack
```

### Add project to Unity

Start up Unity and open the project from the folder you just cloned into.

### Run Given Executable

```bash
cd unity/projects/black_jack/Build
./black_jack.exe
```

or just run it from the file explorer. Either works
